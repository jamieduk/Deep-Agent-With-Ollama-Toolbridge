# üß† Deep Agent CLI: Coding Assistant with Memory
A powerful **command-line interface (CLI)** combining the stateful, multi-agent capabilities of **Deep Agent** with **Toolbridge** for enhanced model compatibility.  
This creates a robust, memory-enabled coding and research assistant powered by **LangGraph** and **Ollama**.

## üîë Prerequisite: API Key Setup (Tavily)

This project requires a **search API key** to enable web-grounding and research functionality.

1. Obtain your API key from [Tavily AI](https://tavily.com).
2. The key must be set as an environment variable in your `start.sh` file.

**Example (`start.sh`):**
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-dev-CHANGE-API-KEYE-HERE"
‚ö° Quick Setup (Recommended)
If you have all prerequisites installed (Python 3.x, Ollama), the auto-setup script will handle environment creation and dependency installation:

bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull minimax-m2:cloud

./setup.sh
üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup
If you prefer more control, follow these steps to manually configure the environment.

1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
2. Install Required Libraries
bash
pip install deepagents tavily
pip install -U langchain-ollama
3. Start the Deep Agent CLI
Ensure your start.sh file includes your Tavily API key, then run:

bash
./start.sh
üíª Example Execution Output
The script activates the environment and initializes the LangGraph architecture:

bash
./start.sh
Virtual Environment Setup and ready!

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It's part of the LangChain ecosystem and is designed to help developers create complex AI workflows that can:

üß© Core Features (Powered by LangGraph)
The Deep Agent framework leverages the following advanced capabilities:

State Management: Maintains context and state across multiple LLM calls or agent interactions.

Multi-Agent Workflows: Enables coordinated interaction between multiple specialized AI agents.

Graph-Based Architecture: Defines complex workflows, decision trees, and reasoning paths.

Human-in-the-Loop: Allows for human intervention and approval at various stages.

Persistence: Saves and resumes ongoing agent workflows.

Streaming: Supports real-time response streaming.

üåâ Toolbridge Integration
This combined project utilizes Toolbridge to enhance compatibility between models.

Toolbridge is required when using models that do not natively support tool calling (function/tool use).
It acts as an intermediary, allowing such models to interact with external tools and functions within the Deep Agent pipeline.
