Deep Agent CLI: Coding Assistant with MemoryA powerful command-line interface (CLI) combining the stateful, multi-agent capabilities of Deep Agent with Toolbridge for enhanced model compatibility. This creates a robust, memory-enabled coding and research assistant powered by LangGraph and Ollama.üîë Prerequisite: API Key Setup (Tavily)This project requires a search API key to enable web-grounding and research functionality.Obtain your API key from Tavily AI.The key needs to be set as an environment variable in your start.sh file.Example API Key Format (Edit in start.sh):export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-dev-CHANGE-API-KEYE-HERE"
‚ö° Quick Setup (Recommended)If you have all prerequisites installed (Python 3.x, Ollama), the auto-setup script will handle environment creation and dependency installation../setup.sh
üõ†Ô∏è Manual SetupIf you prefer more control, follow these steps to manually set up the Python virtual environment and install dependencies.Create and Activate Virtual Environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Libraries:pip install deepagents tavily
pip install -U langchain-ollama
Start the Deep Agent CLI:Ensure you have edited your start.sh file with the correct TAVILY_API_KEY../start.sh
Example Execution OutputThe script will activate the environment and provide context about the underlying LangGraph architecture:./start.sh
Virtual Environment Setup and ready!
LangGraph is a library for building **stateful, multi-agent applications** with Large Language Models (LLMs). It's part of the LangChain ecosystem and is designed to help developers create complex AI workflows that can:

üß† Core Features (Powered by LangGraph)The Deep Agent framework leverages the following advanced capabilities for complex workflows:State Management: Maintains context and state across multiple LLM calls or agent interactions.Multi-Agent Workflows: Enables coordinated interaction between multiple specialized AI agents.Graph-Based Architecture: Defines complex workflows, decision trees, and reasoning paths.Human-in-the-Loop: Allows for human intervention and approval at various stages (if implemented).Persistence: Can save and resume ongoing agent workflows.Streaming: Supports real-time streaming of responses.üåâ Toolbridge IntegrationThis combined project utilizes Toolbridge to enhance compatibility.Toolbridge is required when using models that do not natively support tool calling (function/tool use). It acts as an intermediary, allowing models without native tool support to still interact with external tools and functions defined within the Deep Agent pipeline.Original Toolbridge Repository: https://github.com/Oct4Pie/toolbridgeüîó Project Sources and CreditsThis project builds upon the work of several open-source initiatives:ComponentRepository LinkOriginal Projecthttps://github.com/jamieduk/Deep-Agent-With-Ollama-ToolbridgeDeep Agenthttps://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsToolbridgehttps://github.com/Oct4Pie/toolbridgeLangGraph OverviewYouTube Video: LangGraph Introduction
